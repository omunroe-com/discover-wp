Instructions:-
==============
You can edit the header by editing header.jpg located in the same skin folder and replace it with yours.


==============
Footer Links:-
==============
Since this skin was made for free, I request you to keep the links.
You are NOT allowed to remove the link in the footer.


==============
Sidebar Links:-
==============
You are free to remove the links in the sidebar.
Since the sidebar was looking empty, they were placed to cover the space.
Its up to you to keep them or remove them.
